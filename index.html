            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>I worked as a Data Engineering and Software Engineering Intern (2X) for TD Bank. My time there has been incredible and will be forever greatful 
                to my mentors.

            <section>
            <p>As a Data Engineer [January 2024 - April 2024], I was on the DaaS (Data as a Service) team where I migrated data from onprem to Azure. I've written python scripts in Databricks, 
                set up pipelines on Azure Datafactory but essentially 
                helping teams across the bank migrate their data to the Azure Cloud environment.

            <p>    As a Software Engineer [May 2023 - August 2023] [May 2022 - August 2022], I've worked on internal developer tools and frontend applications respectively. 
            Worked with tools such as Angular, Java, Springboot, Confluence, JIRA and Azure. The tools I made were internal and the frontend applications 
            I've developped were for websites for underwriters.</p>
